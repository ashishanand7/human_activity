## Human Activity Recognition

<br>

This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

## File details:

**HAR_EDA.ipynb** presents Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset alongside some observations on data dimensionality.\
**HAR_PREDICTION_MODELS.ipynb** explores approaches related to classical Machine Learning models and ensembles thereof.\
**HAR_LSTM.ipynb** details training of a LSTM Model for the same purpose.


## Conclusion
Simpler models work better with applied domain knowledge, EDA and appropriate feature engineering.


## Appendix - How data was recorded

By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(_tAcc-XYZ_) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (_tGyro-XYZ_) from Gyroscope with several variations. 

> prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.

> suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.

* Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings are taken from 30 volunteers(referred as subjects) while performing the following 6 Activities.

    1. Walking     
    2. WalkingUpstairs 
    3. WalkingDownstairs 
    4. Standing 
    5. Sitting 
    6. Laying

* Readings are divided into a window of 2.56 seconds with 50% overlapping. 

* Accelerometer readings are divided into gravity acceleration and body acceleration readings,
  which has x,y and z components each.

* Gyroscope readings are the measure of angular velocities which has x,y and z components.

* Jerk signals are calculated for BodyAcceleration readings.

* Fourier Transforms are made on the above time readings to obtain frequency readings.

* Now, on all the base signal readings., mean, max, mad, sma, arcoefficient, engerybands,entropy etc., are calculated for each window.

* We get a feature vector of 561 features and these features are given in the dataset.

* Each window of readings is a datapoint of 561 features.
