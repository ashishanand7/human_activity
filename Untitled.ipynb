    "## Human Activity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File details:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HAR_EDA.ipynb** presents Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset alongside some observations on data dimensionality. \n",
    "**HAR_PREDICTION_MODELS.ipynb** explores approaches related to classical Machine Learning models and ensembles thereof.\n",
    "**HAR_LSTM.ipynb** details training of a LSTM Model for the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Simpler models work better with applied domain knowledge, EDA and appropriate feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appendix - How data was recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(_tAcc-XYZ_) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (_tGyro-XYZ_) from Gyroscope with several variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "> prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings are taken from 30 volunteers(referred as subjects) while performing the following 6 Activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Walking     \n",
    "    2. WalkingUpstairs \n",
    "    3. WalkingDownstairs \n",
    "    4. Standing \n",
    "    5. Sitting \n",
    "    6. Lying.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Readings are divided into a window of 2.56 seconds with 50% overlapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Accelerometer readings are divided into gravity acceleration and body acceleration readings,\n",
    "  which has x,y and z components each.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gyroscope readings are the measure of angular velocities which has x,y and z components.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jerk signals are calculated for BodyAcceleration readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fourier Transforms are made on the above time readings to obtain frequency readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, on all the base signal readings., mean, max, mad, sma, arcoefficient, engerybands,entropy etc., are calculated for each window.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We get a feature vector of 561 features and these features are given in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each window of readings is a datapoint of 561 features."
